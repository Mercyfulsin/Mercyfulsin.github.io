            <p>My name is Andres Ruiz-Velediaz. I am, as of writing this page, 25 years old and am
                currently
                taking part of a bootcamp for Web Development. I have always been fascinated by computers and
                programming
                but have never had the support, friends or financial stability to really get into it at a young age. It
                all
                began when my soccer coach asked if I wanted to be a part of a youth program to get kids into computers.
                I
                accepted and quickly fell in love with everything. The coach saw my passion and decided to pay for my
                first
                year
                in the program. I would continue to go and be a part of the wonderful, yet very small, program from 5th
                grade
                till the end of 9th. The program didn't have enough funding to continue teaching my class and was
                cancelled.
                By
                then I had done a great varying of things, from Dreamweaver, HTML, Building a Computer, Flash and
                Photoshop.<br><br>
                Being a young boy, I was obviously sucked into the gaming aspect of computers. I then became
                fascinated with the idea of "hacking," as most people call it. I wanted to be able to beat a game using
                cheats
                to make my life easier. I quickly scattered down the rabbit hole and made
                lots of online friends and ended up being a part of many "great" projects and communities. I say "great"
                because
                it seemed like a lot to me, but in reality, the communities couldn't have exceeded 5,000 people. I've
                made
                my
                own personal "hacks" and released them for public usage on different forums for different games.
                Unfortunately
                no one in real life that I knew of understood anything to do with computers. I was alone and could only
                find
                solice in the small amount of friends I made online.<br><br>
                My parents would berate me every night about how I would be staying up for hours on end without food or
                going
                out. Constantly telling me I was wasting my time and that all of this would amount to nothing. Being the
                young
                impresionable kid that I was, I quickly became depressed and unmotivated. I lost any and all reason to
                continue
                studying /
                practicing code. Years passed and the people around me continued to call me a genius with computers and
                depend
                on me. But they didn't realize that once you join this field, you quickly realize how LITTLE you
                actually
                know.
                I always tell them that I am a COMPLETE beginner and that there is an infinite amount of things I don't
                know.
                Since then I have attempted to get back into computers and keeping up with news on the latest tech. Yet
                now
                I
                feel completely lost. Almost as
                if the six or more years of neglecting computers had made me completely stupid and unable to learn. This
                is
                when
                I decided I needed some kind of strong-armed attempt at getting back into the scene. So I joined the
                UCSD
                Extension Web Development Bootcamp in order to focus me by providing physical attendence and teachers
                for
                guidence. I hope that by the end
                of the course I will be back to the way I used to be, and take initiative to learn anything and
                everything.
